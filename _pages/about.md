Hi! I'm a computational biologist based in Pune, India. I was a SERB postdoc at IISER Pune, where my work addressed questions on the neurobiology of synaptic transmission and plasticity using computational models. 

My recent research interests have revolved around understanding the following questions: (1) How do the wide array of synaptic plasticity "rules" arise from interactions among chemical signaling pathways in neurons? (2) How do such rules enable learning and memory in the brain? and (3) What can this teach us about the evolutionary history of the nervous system? My work utilizes a combination of math models and informatics approaches, and I'm interested more broadly in the application of computational/data science methods to make sense of complex systems in biology.

Further information about my research profile may be found at the above links. You can contact me at firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.
