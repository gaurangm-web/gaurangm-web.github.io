Hi! I'm a computational biologist based in Pune, India. I was a SERB postdoc at IISER Pune, where my recent research addressed questions on the neurobiology of synaptic transmission and plasticity using computational models. 

Broadly, my current research interests revolve around understanding how the wide array of synaptic plasticity "rules" arise from interactions among chemical signaling pathways in neurons, how such rules enable learning and memory in the brain, and what they can teach us about the evolutionary history of the nervous system. My work utilizes a combination of math models and informatics approaches.

Further information about my research profile may be found at the above links. You can contact me at firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.
